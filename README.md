# Description

These folders contain custom Reinforcement Learning algorithms implemented in Python, in addition to an implementation of the OpenAI Gym environment for the CartPole system.

The folders are organized as follows:
- Algorithms implementation including algorithms such as Explore, Greedy, Epsilon-Greedy, Explore-Then-Commit, UCB, Thompson Sampling, and Gittins Index.
- CartPole environment implementation.
- MDP Value Iteration, Exact Policy Iteration, and Iterative Policy Evaluation.
